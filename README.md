# Python Programs for List, Tuple, Dictionary, Set, and List Comprehension Operations

## Overview
This project consists of five small Python programs that demonstrate the use of lists, tuples, dictionaries, sets, and list comprehensions. Each program interacts with the user and performs simple data manipulations.

### Programs Included:

1. **Sum of Integers in a List**:
   - The program accepts user input to create a list of integers.
   - It computes and prints the sum of all the integers in the list.

2. **Tuple of Favorite Books**:
   - A tuple containing the names of five favorite books is created.
   - A for loop is used to print each book name on a new line.

3. **Person Information Using a Dictionary**:
   - The program stores user input (name, age, favorite color) in a dictionary.
   - It prints the dictionary to the console.

4. **Common Elements in Two Sets**:
   - The program accepts user input to create two sets of integers.
   - It finds and prints the common elements between the two sets.

5. **Words with Odd Number of Characters**:
   - The program stores a list of words and uses list comprehension to find words with an odd number of characters.
   - It prints the filtered list of words.

## How to Run the Programs
1. Ensure you have Python installed (version 3.6 or higher).
2. Copy the code into a `.py` file or run it in a Python environment (like VS Code or Jupyter Notebook).
3. Follow the prompts for user input.
