# List Operations in Python

## Overview

This project demonstrates basic list operations in Python. The program performs the following tasks:
1. Creates an empty list.
2. Appends several values to the list.
3. Inserts a value at a specific position in the list.
4. Extends the list with another list.
5. Removes the last element from the list.
6. Sorts the list in ascending order.
7. Finds and prints the index of a specific value in the list.

## Steps Included:

### 1. Create an Empty List
- The list is created using the syntax `my_list = []`.

### 2. Append Elements to the List
- Elements `10, 20, 30, 40` are appended to the list using the `append()` method.

### 3. Insert a Value at a Specific Position
- The value `15` is inserted at the second position using `insert(index, value)`.

### 4. Extend the List with Another List
- The list is extended with `[50, 60, 70]` using the `extend()` method.

### 5. Remove the Last Element
- The last element is removed using the `pop()` method, which by default removes the last item.

### 6. Sort the List
- The list is sorted in ascending order using the `sort()` method.

### 7. Find and Print the Index of a Specific Value
- The index of the value `30` is found using the `index(value)` method.
